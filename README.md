# ⚡ Pulse

> *"Not a dashboard. An instrument panel."*

**Pulse** is a cinematic, terminal-based system monitor built for enthusiasts who crave high-density telemetry with a premium aesthetic. Every panel animates; nothing is static.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Transcendence Modes**: Fullscreen immersive views for every subsystem.
- **Neural Insight Engine**: Heuristic analysis of system bottlenecks.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Cycle through high-contrast palettes (Key: `T`).
- **High-Precision Pulse**: Up to 0.2s sampling rate for micro-stutter detection.
- **Direct OS Engine**: High-performance architecture with zero external build dependencies.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fatin-Ishraq/Pulse.git
cd Pulse
pip install .
python -m pulse
```

That's it. No Rust, no build tools, no extra steps.
